# Python-3-DES-algorithm

This repository contains all the source code for the d.e.s implementation i have made.

des64v1.py --> code of the algorithm itself.
test.py --> code to test the algorithm.

The "cipher" function takes as input 64 bits of plain text + 56 bits key, and outputs 64 bits of crypted text.

The "reverse-cipher" function takes as input 64 bits of encrypted text + 56 bits key, and outputs 64 bits of decrypted text.
